# Hey Everyone! 🤜🏼 🤛🏻

I'm a Developer Community Team Lead at [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). I design and architect developer ecosystems as well as build developer tooling and analytics around them. If you'd like to know more about my professional background visit my [github-linkedin repo](https://github.com/konradsopala/github-linkedin) or my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konradsopala/).

When it comes to my interests I love running, cycling, travelling and reading. If you'd like to chat, hit me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/konradsopala)! I'm open to talk about anything from software engineering, developer relations to campervans, Pad Thais etc!

Happy coding and see ya online! 🐥
